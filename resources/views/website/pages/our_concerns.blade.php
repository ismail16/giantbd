        <p style="color: #000;">Giant Agro Processing Limited – GAPL, is an agro based company involved in the production, processing, preservation- storage and marketing of hybrid vegetable seeds, with a core focus on potato seeds. The enterprise is managed by a team of experienced and highly skilled professionals in agriculture and seed technology. GAPL, a sister concern of the Giant Group, established over ten years, has earned its reputation to be an innovative and socially responsible institution. GAPL operations and facilities are mainly located in Thakurgaon, north-western part of Bangladesh, an area known for the best quality of potato production in Bangladesh and where many other vegetables and grains are cultivated all year round. A progressive approach to agricultural development has been GAPL’s vision, which has always ensured superior quality of output. Innovation in seed- research and development sets the foundation of GAPL’s operation.<br><br>

        Bangladesh produces 75 million tons of potatoes making it the fourth most important crop in the Bangladesh economy. GAPL commenced seed potato business in 2006, envisioning an opportunity to improve farm prosperity with better seed inputs. Since then GAPL contributed to a key pillar in agricultural prosperity by supplying farmers with high-productivity early generation tubers. The company has within a very short time developed a wide marketing and distribution network covering 30 districts in the northern part of the country. The marketing network is being gradually expanded to other region of the country through provision of own marketing personnel and developing dealer’s network.<br><br>

        The goal is to provide trustworthy, high yielding seeds potato, vegetable and cereal seeds to farmers in the country to increase farm income. The company also intends to supply other agro-inputs at competitive price to our vast farming community.
        Our mission is to provide pure, clean and ergonomically sound seeds to the farmers, growers and others agri-customers at affordable price, promoting increased marketing opportunities for their commodities in local and even international markets.
        We oversee the growth of our tubers at special site in Thakurgoan to ensure that we supply first-generation seed potatoes of highest quality. We partner with selected, experienced and trained farmers to grow potatoes from Generation 1 (G1) to Generation 4 (G4) with extensive quality checks at each stage along the way. <br><br>

        Giant Agro is engaged in agriculture of disease free quality seed potatoes on an area of hundreds of acres of owned land as well as leased land from farmers, resulting in production of over 2000 tons of high quality potato seed annually which is preserved in self-owned Cold Store.
