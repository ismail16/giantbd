            <h4  style="color: #000;" style="text-align:left;"> Water consumption </h4>
            <p style="color: #000;">As Dhaka’s population density grows, the added infrastructure and development means water usage goes up as well. At all of our sites, we have implemented optimal water-usage strategies to avoid wastage. Low water-usage toilet and plumbing fixtures are used. We are planning to use harvested rainwater for gardening and flushing the toilets. Our ultimate goal is to be water neutral.</p><br>


            <h4  style="color: #000;" style="text-align:left;">Energy Efficient </h4>
            <p style="color: #000;">Facilities are designed for low energy consumption by reducing power-demand and by using energy-efficient equipment.</p>
            <ul style="color: #000;">
                <li>•   The older clutch and plate motor machines have all been replaced with energy efficient direct drive and servo motor driven machines. These latest machines consume around five times less energy</li>
                <li>•   All regular fluorescent bulbs are being decommissioned and replaced with energy efficient T5 tubes and needle point LED lamps.</li>
                <li>•   The building design aims to maximize the penetration of natural light.</li>
                <li>•   Efficiently designed ducted ventilation system and evaporative water cooling system are used to always keep indoor air fresh. </li>
                <li>•   Windows are maximizedand the use of skylights, light shelf and strategically located windows allow for greater indirect daylight penetration.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul><br>
